Program's ustage:

There are 2 programs in my project.

2,Used to to get the list of tweets that user has.

Process:

1,Please  create  a empty python file, and  name it 'key.py'.
2,Write down the code below.
3,Enter the 'API key','API secret key', 'Access token',and 'the Access token secret' (you can get it from https://developer.twitter.com/en.html)
4,Put the file  'key.py' in a directory the the program can read it.
5,Run the program.

CK = 'Enter the API key'
CS = 'Enter the API secret key'
AT = 'Enter the Access token'
AS = 'Enter the Access token secret'

Attention:
 (Item "replies"s not contained in the both 2 programs,because Twitter's API doesn't allow you to get replies to a particular tweet.)
